- Check data type 
- Check the number of unique value of each columns 
- Check statistics of data set 
- chack various catgories presnet in teh different categorical columns 


## Insight or Observation 
- From the above description of numerical data , all means are very close to each other - between 66 and 69
- All the standard deviation are also close between 14.6 - 15.19 
- While there is a minimum of 0 for maths , other are having 17 and 10 value

# Education Policies and Forward-Looking Steps:

### Equal Opportunities in Education:

- Children's success is shaped not only by their academic skills but also by environmental factors (e.g., parental education, test preparation courses). Understanding the impact of these factors is critical to creating equal opportunities.

### Inclusive Education Programs:

- Education policies can provide programs customized to students' needs by taking such interactions into account. For example, different support programs or test preparation courses can be organized according to the level of parental education.

### Expanding Support Programs:

- Making opportunities such as test preparation courses more accessible to students with low-income and less educated parents can reduce achievement gaps.
